- *rotate_screen.sh* : helper script to rotate the screen 
- *sparql.py* : python file that can be run to apply the SparQL query on the CoGent database. The images will be downloaded locally. From these results, a selection was made and they can be accessed through the */cogent* path of the photobooth.
